## Project Overview

Smart Resume AI is a cutting-edge platform that revolutionizes the job application process by leveraging artificial intelligence to analyze resumes and identify skill gaps. Our solution addresses the critical challenge of resume optimization by providing data-driven insights that help job seekers align their qualifications with employer requirements.

### The Problem We Solve

In today's competitive job market, professionals face significant challenges:

- **Skill Gap Blindness**: 73% of job seekers are unaware of missing skills for their target roles
- **Resume Misalignment**: Traditional resumes fail to highlight relevant skills for specific positions
- **Career Development Confusion**: Without clear feedback, professionals don't know which skills to develop
- **Time-Intensive Analysis**: Manual resume review and gap identification is time-consuming and subjective

### Our Solution

Smart Resume AI combines advanced natural language processing with Google's Gemini AI to deliver:

- **Intelligent Resume Parsing**: Advanced OCR and NLP to extract skills from PDF/Word documents
- **Contextual Gap Analysis**: AI-powered comparison between resume skills and job requirements
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Actionable insights for skill development and career growth
